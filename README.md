Sertis 2025 Data Science Internship Assignment

## Problem 1: Fraud Prediction

Problem Statement : The rise of digital payments has made transactions faster and more convenient, but it has also introduced significant risks of fraudulent activity. Credit card fraud not only results in financial losses for businesses and consumers but also undermines trust in payment systems. To combat this challenge, robust fraud detection systems are essential. As a Data Scientist at Sertis, you are tasked with developing a machine learning model to identify potentially fraudulent credit card transactions using a dataset of anonymized transactions made by European cardholders in 2023. Additionally, the client has requested for interpretability especially in cases where a transaction has been declared as fraud since one must know why a transaction has been declared as fraud. The dataset (here) contains over 550,000 records with features representing transaction characteristics while ensuring the privacy of cardholders. The dataset can be downloaded from here. Please refer to the README file, attached within, for detailed information on the dataset. For evaluating your model, consider the approach of splitting the given dataset into training and a test sets. You can use the test set to evaluate the performance of your model.

## Evaluation Criteria

For the assignment that you choose, you will be tested on:

1. EDA and Conclusions : Conduct an in-depth EDA on the chosen dataset and draw actionable insights. Reflect these insights in your feature engineering and modeling choices.
2. Development : Develop an appropriate algorithm/model using the chosen dataset. Justify your choices for your model/algorithm of choice, data splitting, and hyperparameter tuning. Discuss the trade-offs involved .
3. Evaluation : Clearly explain your evaluation criteria and the metrics of choice to gauge your algorithm/model's performance using these metrics. Discuss any issues encountered, such as overfitting or underfitting, lack of data, and how you mitigated them.
4. Documentation : Maintain thorough code documentation, including docstrings and inline comments. Good documentation includes not just what the code does, but why it does it.
5. Reasoning : As you work through your chosen problem, articulate your thought process. Explain the rationale behind your actions, your interpretations of the results, and your future steps.
